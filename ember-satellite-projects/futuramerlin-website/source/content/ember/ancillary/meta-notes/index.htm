<h2>Prerequisites for succeeding with Ember</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Finish school, so that I have a degree, and can get a job and support myself financially, and use that degree to be respected by people (have them take my ideas seriously).</li>
    <li>Learn to communicate with people in such a manner that they take me seriously, and don't reject my ideas without considering their merits or based on the consequences of my being neuroatypical.</li>
    <li>Become friends with people who are interested in the Ember project, both because it is a complex project and will need assistance to complete, and because I will be much better able to function if I have friends. At least one of these people should be good at business and planning. Also because it's nice having friends, and it is hopefully nice for them too.</li>
    <li>Learn how to express my plans without them sounding unrealistic, so that the people I must become friends with don't decide I'm too idealistic before I get them interested in the project.</li>
    <li>Learn to: focus on what I'm working on, persistently work on it without getting distracted, and regulate my sleep schedule and my other lifestyle choices in a logical manner regardless of what I feel like doing at any given moment.</li>
    <li>Learn to think about things in a manner that enables breaking them down into logical parts that I can realistically accomplish, even when the overarching project is enormous.</li>
</ul>
