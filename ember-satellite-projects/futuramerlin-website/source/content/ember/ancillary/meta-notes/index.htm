<h2>To do</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Add version injector into Web site build script</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites for succeeding with Ember</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Finish school, so that I have a degree, and can get a job and support myself financially, and use that degree to be respected by people (have them take my ideas seriously).</li>
    <li>Learn to communicate with people in such a manner that they take me seriously, and don't reject my ideas without considering their merits or based on the consequences of my being neuroatypical.</li>
    <li>Become friends with people who are interested in the Ember project, both because it is a complex project and will need assistance to complete, and because I will be much better able to function if I have friends. At least one of these people should be good at business and planning. Also because it's nice having friends, and it is hopefully nice for them too.</li>
    <li>Learn how to express my plans without them sounding unrealistic, so that the people I must become friends with don't decide I'm too idealistic before I get them interested in the project.</li>
    <li>Learn to: focus on what I'm working on, persistently work on it without getting distracted, and regulate my sleep schedule and my other lifestyle choices in a logical manner regardless of what I feel like doing at any given moment.</li>
    <li>Learn to think about things in a manner that enables breaking them down into logical parts that I can realistically accomplish, even when the overarching project is enormous.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Ember spiritual framework</p>
<p>The Ember multimedia artwork</p>
<p>Another aspect of Ember is a multimedia artwork, consisting of several components. Blossom &amp; Leaf is a planned multimedia story centered around two characters, named Blossom and Leaf. I would like to write a webcomic (this is called Images), produce a film called Blossom &amp; Leaf, and produce a band called Blossom &amp; Leaf. The fictional world within which the story takes place is called Ilien. The story is very much a work in progress.</p>
<p>In-universe reference</p>
<p>This section will discuss the story within the context of the fictional universe.</p>
<p>Characters</p>
<p>Blossom</p>
<p>Blossom is a character in the Blossom &amp; Leaf story. </p>

  <li>Gender: Female</li>
  <li>Species: ilentu</li>
  <li>Date born: 128 IY 2048</li>
  <li>Personality: Kind and empathetic. A little bit psycho with a thing for blood.</li>
  <li>Strength: ∞</li>
</ul>
<p>Leaf</p>
<p>Leaf is a character in the Blossom &amp; Leaf story. Basically a combination of Goku, Belldandy, Abel Nightrode, and Kenpachi Zaraki. </p>
<p>(This page describes his current condition, rather than his condition at earlier points in the story) </p>
<ul>
  <li>Picture: (have one hand drawn but not a very good one… will scan and upload sometime or other maybe)</li>
  <li>Gender: Male</li>

<p>Last night (the night connecting 11 Sept. 2014 and 12 Sept. 2014) I had a dream that gave me some information.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I had telekinetic powers. God was a thing that reminded me of the stuffed spider in the oatmeal bucket in john edwards market, except monochrome dark brown. And, a lot bigger (same scale as butts). He orbited the earth. He was over the united states in the summer. That was wehre i was too. I saw him in the himalayas too in the dream, but i wasn't there (that was when i didn't have any powers isnce he wasn't over america.)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>His presence over a place wa needed for powers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>There were many powers given by Him, but usually a person only had one (e.g. mine = telekinesis). It took me a while to learn again (i'd been able to do this a long time ago but thought it was a dream) but a friend tought me telekinesis again refreshing my memory. She wore blue dress with light blue grid marks ~1/2" square from each other.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I could fly using my telekinesis byy levitating myself, as i could levitate other things.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I also dreamed that people with psyschic powers like me &amp; my friend were that way because of being mutants. And because of nanomachines. Both those ideas seem to conflic with the idea of god granted power. And the second seems too be kresnik ripoff.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most people at this time did not know the existence of these abilities (secret society kindd of thing).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Chi was the mechanism of the powers.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Places</p>
<p>Ilien</p>
<p>Ilien, the world within which the Blossom &amp; Leaf story takes place, is a planet within the same universe as Earth.</p>
<p>Years</p>
<p>Cultures</p>
<p>Languages</p>
<p>Ilentu</p>
<p>Has at least two scripts, one of which is very curly like the cursive form of Anoé, and one which is more practical, like my old syllabic version of Ilentu.</p>
