<h2>Library Section 1: Basic knowledge, included as text as part of this specification</h2>
<h2>Library Section 2: Great cultural works, included as digital data as part of this specification</h2>
<p>The Ember Heritage Library is a collection of documents, including various great creative works, useful reference works, and rare information. It is part of this book, and should be included with it in the final version #TODO.</p>
<h3>Using the Web environment</h3>
<p>The Media Library includes a Web environment as a Vagrant virtual machine. For more information on installing and using Vagrant, visit the Vagrant Documentation Web site at https://docs.vagrantup.com/ (HashiCorp n.d.) or reference the book <i>Vagrant: Up and Running</i> (Hashimoto, Mitchell, 2013) (Hashimoto 28 May 2013). Vagrant requires VirtualBox to be installed. When using it, it may be advisable to disconnect the media library’s storage medium before running vagrant destroy, because if you are running Vagrant as a user with write permission to the folder, it may follow the symlink and erase it. This seems to possibly be a bug in Vagrant; this may be related to this issue https://github.com/MSOpenTech/vagrant-azure/issues/30 (npoggi 2014)</p>
<p>To start using the Web environment, cd to the “Meta/Web environment” folder. If there is not a Vagrantfile in the folder (there should be), run:</p>
<pre><code>vagrant init https://archive.org/download/virtualbox_201501/virtualbox.box</code></pre>
<p>and update the Vagrantfile as desired. If there is already a Vagrantfile, continue to the next step:</p>
<pre><code>vagrant up</code></pre>
<h2>Library Section 3: The data held by the Ember cloud infrastructure (will presumably be too much information to be part of this book, although future information storage technology advances may render that less of an issue)</h2>
