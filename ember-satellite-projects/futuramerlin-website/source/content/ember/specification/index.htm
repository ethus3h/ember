</p>
<p>The specifications of the Ember society are the “laws” that make it work. However, they are not laws in the traditional sense, inasmuch as any person is free to leave Ember at any time. However, if a person violates the rules of Ember while they are not a member of it, then if they chose to become a member of it again, they may be penalized for such violations.</p>

<h2>Principles and philosophy</h2>

<p>Figure out how the economy works, in terms of wealth creation and destruction - "An economy based on endless growth is UNSUSTAINABLE" - Muse "The 2nd Law". Is the wealth created by time spent working (the wealth as the time working, not the wealth the work created) destroyed when the worker is compensated? (There would presumably be new wealth created by whatever the worker was hired to do, such as making something - but what if they're a clerk or something?)</p>
<p>One role of Ember would be to provide goods. For this, it would be ideal for Ember to control as much of the supply chain as possible. That would allow efficient provision of the goods such as to reduce cost and ensure quality. That control of the supply chain would, in an ideal scenario, extend to all stages of the process, from production of the raw materials to component production to assembly to distribution, as well as shipping at all stages of the process. If Ember both controlled production of raw materials in a region and was the dominant institution working to ensure that those resources are used responsibly, it would of course be important to take the interest Ember has in using the resources sustainably into consideration. </p>
<p>Ember is a multifaceted project to develop a scalable environment for building an effective society.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>Create a system to enable efficacy, efficiency, and justice of society.</p>
<p>The Ember Project would create a global power structure that would work to create an efficient opt-in society.</p>
<h2>Project structure and implementation</h2>
<p>Ember will achieve these goals through creating individual components that each provide an integral part of the whole societal system. Implementation will probably need to be undertaken in stages, given the nature of </p>
<p>The Ember project aims to create an adequate infrastructure for managing and providing for the basic needs of society. This organization could exist alongside governments and other social structures, as well as potentially taking their place in the event that they collapse or fail to perform as expected (as appears to be happening, for example, in several African countries) (Fund For Peace 2014; Wikipedia 2014).</p>
<p>In this section, the term “person” is used to refer to any independent, quantizable (able to be assessed discretely and independently of other elements) unit with a soul; a firmer, more satisfactory, analytical definition of the term unfortunately eludes me at present, as is a complete understanding of whether some things are rightly considered as persons. For example, does a rock have a soul? If that rock is split in two, does each resulting portion have its own soul?</p>
<p>This project would, in its complete form, provide useful elements of survival: shelter, nutrition (including food and water), medical care, education, and information. It would do this as its fulfilment of its objective of managing the various needs of a society, by enabling people to be effective participants in that society. </p>
<h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>In my view, as human society is sometimes unpredictable in the rights and safeties it affords those partaking of its benefits, I believe there is a need for a unified institution to be established outside of the realms of traditional governmental structures to provide some semblance of a filling of this void. While humans, as any other life, have the liberty of doing as they choose, and, in one way of looking at things, have no obligation to any particular social contract or structure, — (in other words — technically, everyone has the choice to do what they want, inasmuch as they can send the electrical signals to their nerves they choose to when they choose to, assuming they have such physical capacity) — while such “liberty” is indeed held by humans, they have come to expect and rely upon such social constructs for their safety and mutual benefit. For such reasons I feel it ideal to pursue the measure of establishing a single institution as I mentioned above. Those who choose not to partake of the protections I propose that such an organization would provide would, of course, open themselves up to forceful control by any who see fit: they would end up finding themselves in Hobbes' “state of nature”, “all at war with all” (HON211 2014). Locke writes that “The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on earth” … “to have only the law of nature for his rule” (Locke 1997, p. 15). There presently exist many types of authority in the world, for example: the law of war, the principles established by the United Nations and similar organizations, the laws established by states' governments and their constituents (in the United States this would encompass the powers vested in the national, state, county, and township authorities, for example), and the bounds enforced within a family. What I propose in this essay does not neatly fall into any of those categories. It would not attempt to interfere with those authorities, allowing it to coexist with them — thus its purpose being mainly the protection of and provision for those people who choose to become, so to speak, the shareholders and benefactors of its contract. It would ideally provide some recourse for those who would desire asylum from those other power structures, by holding land, under its exclusive control, that it could share in various ways. These ways could include through the issuance of private parcels within which the owners could dictate their terms, and through the construction of tenements made available without charge to those participating in the organization I propose. Within all of these, parcels and tenements, the sole binding policy (in other words, the protections and/or restraints imposed through the organization's policy, doctrine, and practice) would be those of the organization (beyond any that may be held by private landholders). (There could also be, and in all probability would be, unallocated land over which no control is held or claimed.) Through allocation of such private parcels, large governments could theoretically be provided land technically held by this organization I propose, them being given authority over the land to dispense of as they choose — although such an arrangement would perhaps be unnecessary, as land with existing power structures would presumably be already managed in fair order. Locke writes that a king's privilege “may be questioned, opposed, and resisted” if he uses “unjust force”. In all, the basic premise of what I propose is yet another layer of order provided on an opt-in basis within the context of a world which is, fundamentally, in what I would consider a state of nature with power structures founded within it. (This brings to mind one of my arguments against some philosophical ideals of “anarchy”: the true absence of any social order imposed on the world would by definition allow the imposition of order by those within it, thus creating something of a paradox.) And yet, Locke writes that if “the electors or ways of election are altered without the consent and contrary to the common interest of the people” then “those chosen are not the legislative appointed by the people” (Locke 1997, p. 121). This is used as a justification for revolution, for example in Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, as mentioned in Professor Glover's lecture [TODO cite]. </p>
<p>I believe that the general rules of this organization should be established on the basis of rights: rather than making a rule that, for example, prohibits murder, instead a rule should be established that protects individuals’ right to life. In such a way, rules would not be created that infringe freedom more than that which is necessary to retain order in society. </p>
<p>In the event that an individual who is party to the organization has interests that conflict with the interest of, for example, a government within the context of which this organization exists, such action should be taken as is deemed prudent and sensible. It would be, for example, distinctly unwise to antagonize a militarily powerful government the citizens of which are under threat from an individual who is party to this organization in the interest of protecting this individual’s rights. It can be considered that all who are not a member of any given social contract being discussed are in a state of nature. In this document, the social contract being discussed is that held between the members of this organization. From this perspective, there is no evident reason not to hunt for food those who are not party to this contract (for the same reason that humans hunt deer even when they are part of a social contract that forbids killing each other, since the deer are not party to their social contract); however it would likely be imprudent to hunt those who are protected by an institution with a strong military force. </p>
<p>In my model world-state, such an organization is sufficiently extensive and effective as to in effect preclude the necessity of separate governments, outside of the individual community branches of the organization serving to manage the organization’s local presence and interests. </p>
<h2>The Ember Language</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Information studies: The Ember language and logical system</li>
</ul>
<p>This section covers the subjects: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Identifiers (Abstract identifiers; sets, lists, and other groups)</li>
  <li>Language (grammatical words; other words and their meanings; expressions and sentences; logic and proofs)</li>
  <li>Quantities (Quantitative information, constant and abstract (mathematics); their application in modeling the physical world; their abstract applications (such as in business))</li>
</ul>
<p>Because these subjects are all related, the section will cover the essentials in the order they should be learned for basic comprehension (dependency bootstrapping); and then include additional knowledge that can be pieced together as desired. These areas will cover the traditional disciplines of: mathematics, including algebra, geometry, calculus, and discrete mathematics; logic; and language.</p>
