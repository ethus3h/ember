<h2>Principles and philosophy</h2>

<pre>Figure out how the economy works, in terms of wealth creation and destruction - "An economy based on endless growth is UNSUSTAINABLE" - Muse "The 2nd Law". Is the wealth created by time spent working (the wealth as the time working, not the wealth the work created) destroyed when the worker is compensated? (There would presumably be new wealth created by whatever the worker was hired to do, such as making something - but what if they're a clerk or something?)
