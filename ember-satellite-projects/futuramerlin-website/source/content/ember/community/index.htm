<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>The central part of Ember, which its other parts are constructed to serve, is those people who have chosen to become members of the Ember organization. This organization will impose no restrictions on those who chose to become its members apart from the protection of their rights (and any restrictions that such protection entails), and anyone can choose to become a part of it or to leave it at any time. Becoming a member involves being listed in the central Ember computing environment database, presumably with sufficient biometric data to prevent identity theft or other fraudulent activity. Names, addresses, or other such personal information, beyond the biometric data previously mentioned, would not be required for the process of becoming a member. Members are not obligated to use any of the services provided by Ember, and could request at any time the termination of any services presently provided to them, including (I suppose?) even the basic protection of their human rights that Ember should by default provide.</p>
<h2>Services collective</h2>
<p>Another component of the Ember organization is a not-for-profit services collective that organizes the procurement and distribution of goods and services for its members, and perhaps those who are not its members as well. The goal of this organization would be to provide any needful things desired by its members for their lives. For instance, if a person chose to receive food through Ember, they could request that it be provided in exchange for labor. Their labor would help contribute to services requested in the future by them or other Ember members. The organization should have 24/7 available buildings staffed by Ember members from whom aid could be sought, such as the furnishing of meals, shelter, clothing, access to information, or other services, in exchange for labor. That way, if an Ember member is in trouble in a strange town, for instance, with no money, identification (beyond their own body), or other resources, they could go to the local Ember building to receive any services they desire; they could even build up credit in preparation for such an incident by working for the Ember collective prior to taking a trip, for instance, so they would have already earned any services they might want — travel insurance, of sorts.</p>

<h2>Contention</h2>
<p>Land property rights are often contentious. For example, if most of the farmers in a community use barbed wire to impede predators’ travel onto his property, thus averting the risk they present to their livestock, but a landowner whose property is surrounded on all sides by the property of these farmers wants to hunt the predators for their fur, there is a conflict between the interests of the landowners: the presence of barbed wire will interfere with the enclosed property’s supply of fur, while the absence of it will interfere with the outer properties’ supplies of livestock. For this reason, I think that the best solution is to have private land allocations be relatively small, and surrounded by buffer zones of publically owned land. In general, privately owned land could then be used in whatever manner desired by its owner. Some exceptions to this that seem to me rather inevitable would be: the use of streams (interfering with a stream to the detriment of public access or downstream property owner(s) should be restricted); the introduction of invasive species (as they can spread to public land or other properties); the introduction of dangerous quantities of radioactive substances (as they can present a health hazard to life outside of the property); and so on and so forth. These restrictions seem to be a necessary evil until a solution to the problem is found. </p>
<p>A system for punishment for violating the standards of this organization could be created by the removal of benefits and protections provided by it. </p>
