<p class="big space-above">Ember is a project to develop a specification and infrastructure to help create successful communities.</p>
<p>Ember has four primary components: a specification, a community, a computing environment, and a library. Those components are currently unfinished. In the process of developing those components, other ancillary projects (mostly software) have been created, some of which are stable and ready for use.</p>
