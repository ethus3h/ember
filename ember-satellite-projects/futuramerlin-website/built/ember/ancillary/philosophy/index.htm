They are presented here in the Ember section of the Web site because they may be useful in understanding the thought processes and potential biases that shaped the Ember project.</p> <h2 id="Friendship">Friendship</h2> <p>Throughout my life, I have experienced one, perhaps two or three depending on where the cutoff is set, close friendships; in this section I will discuss and generalize based on my experiences with these three friendships. One of them I would consider a current close friend. From these experiences, I have concluded that friendship is an extremely important connection to have in one's life. It has helped me feel much more sane and grounded, and I hope that it has affected my friends similarly. I value my friendships immensely. My past friendships have faded away largely due to my failure to keep in touch regularly, resulting in my drifting away from my friends. (That was the ultimate causal factor, although it was triggered by other causes in both cases.) At the time, that was simply procrastination on my part, but in retrospect I feel the loss deeply, although it is tempered by my having currently established a friendship. Consequently, one of my greatest fears at present is that such a failure to stay in touch will result in yet another lost friendship, or that one or more of my many other personal failings will destroy it. I identify the following factors as likely threats to my friendship's stability (many of them also apply to my interactions with others in general):</p> <ul> <li>I feel a strong sense of caring for my friends, but I know from experience that I can hurt others' emotions when I speak in anger. I wish to never hurt those for whom I care in this way, but I do not trust myself in that regard.</li> <li>My difficulty with understanding others' subtle emotions and with interacting socially may cause miscommunications and, possibly, harm to others.</li> <li>As I am not very economically secure, I fear that I may be unable to be there to support my friends in times of need.</li> <li>I don't always know how to understand others' personal desires and boundaries, and I fear that others may not express these clearly to me out of concern for my feelings; consequently, I may not be able to act appropriately in some situations.</li> <li>On a related note to the previous point, I fear that I place a burden on others by excessive feeling-sorry-for-myself and being needy (I find that my friends end up caring for me much more than I end up caring for them, while I would expect that more equal friendships would be more stable). In addition, my lack of confidence in myself and my actions may grow wearing to others, due to my constant tendency to ask for confirmation or validation of my actions and desires. (I plan to share this writing with my friends ostensibly to help them understand me better, but that would likely constitute the sort of obnoxious wallowing in my self-pity and seeking validation or comfort for it that I am herein criticising.)</li> <li>I end up spending a lot of time stressing out about these issues, and over endlessly recursive paradoxes such as that described in the parenthetical at the end of the previous bullet point. I don't think that such stress is particularly beneficial or productive.</li> <li>I sometimes fail to be accepting of others, to live healthily, and to abide by the ethical standards in which I believe, and am often prone to hypocritical criticism of the world around me. These traits of my personality and behavior almost certainly are a source of friction in my relationships with others, as well as in my relationship to society as a whole, and within my own mind.</li> </ul> <p>I think that mutual trust and clear, respectful sharing of knowledge and feelings are very important in preserving friendships (note that despite my belief in this, I frequently fail to act in accordance with it, due to the vagaries of embarrassment and shyness/self-consciousness). Although, if someone doesn't have any complaints regarding my behavior and actions, I am likely to assume that they are simply remaining silent out of concern for my feelings; that leaves the other person in sort of a catch-22.</p> </main> </body> </html>
