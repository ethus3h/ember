At least one of these people should be good at business and planning. Also because it's nice having friends, and it is hopefully nice for them too.</li> <li>Learn how to express my plans without them sounding unrealistic, so that the people I must become friends with don't decide I'm too idealistic before I get them interested in the project.</li> <li>Learn to: focus on what I'm working on, persistently work on it without getting distracted, and regulate my sleep schedule and my other lifestyle choices in a logical manner regardless of what I feel like doing at any given moment.</li> <li>Learn to think about things in a manner that enables breaking them down into logical parts that I can realistically accomplish, even when the overarching project is enormous.</li> </ul> <h2 id="Things_to_develop">Things to develop</h2> <h3 id="Things_I_want_to_make_for_myself">Things I want to make for myself</h3> <ul> <li>Book scanner</li> <li>House</li> <li>Clothing</li> </ul> <h3 id="Things_I_intend_to_develop_a_better_version_of_.28long-term_.2F_difficult_projects.29">Things I intend to develop a better version of (long-term / difficult projects)</h3> <ul> <li>Housing</li> <li> Computers: <ul class="nested-list"> <li>Desktop</li> <li>Server</li> <li>Laptop</li> <li>Handheld</li> </ul> </li> <li>Clothing</li> </ul></main> </body> </html>
