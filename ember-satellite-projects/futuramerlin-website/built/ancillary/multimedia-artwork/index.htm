An Ilienian year is divided into 256 days.</p> <p>The aetheric plane is made of what is percieved as dark matter in the wave plane (the plane with Earth in it), and vice versa. When matter/energy in one plane is given the correct resonance values, it can influence matter/energy in the other plane.</p> <p>The two main characters of the story, Elen and Nat, are raceless and genderless.</p> <h2 id="Part_1:_Dusk">Part 1: Dusk</h2> <p>Elen (/elen/) and Nat (/nat/) were created by the government of the aetheric plane, the government representing the four groups Fairies (air), Dragons (fire), Aelfe (earth), and Undines (water). They are the most technologically sophisticated beings ever created. Thousands of years ago, the existance of the wave plane and the resonance force were discovered accidentally. At that time, Ilien was slightly more technologically advanced than Earth as of this writing. Technology in Ilien has improved greatly since then, and the government identified the existence of extraplanar life by laying galaxy-scale antennae across many lightyears' worth of space, and those antennae picked up SETI broadcasts from Earth. Deducing from these broadcasts that Earth has life, they created Elen and Nat to explore Earth. [The reader doesn't know this yet, but their purpose was exploration with the intent of using them to enable conquering Earth. Earth is the first extra-Ilienian life that has been found so far. Elen and Nat, through both their nature and the ideas they developed on Earth, prevent this invasion.]</p> <p>Elen and Nat are sent to Earth in travel pods, by altering their resonance so they pass into the wave plane and then shoot toward Earth. They land on opposite sides of the Earth, are disguised as humans by the Ilienian government, and awaken for the first time. They do not have any knowledge at this point, except that they should report what they discover while living as humans back to Ilien using transmitters in their ships, after 20 years. Elen arrives in Japan, and eventually makes zer way to El Caminito del Rey. Ze runs along it, and at the end of it jumps into the air and begins flying. Nat arrives in Brazil or somewhere. Eventually, they encounter each other. They succeed at returning data, transmitting it back to Ilien. They fall in love. They have become dissatisfied with Earth's governments, and are inspiried to create a social welfare initiative. Several more stints of the same task (living as humans) are ordered, and they succeed. After their second mission, which they accomplished together. They are in the sunset being romantic together, and they discuss how Earth really does not need more human population, since their project has enabled longer lifespans leading in the direction of overpopulation.</p> <h2 id="Part_2:_Night">Part 2: Night</h2> <p>As they have now demonstrated their loyalty to the Ilien government through the successful completion of their missions, the Ilienian government partly unlocks their soulbinding abilities to have them conquer Earth, so they can destroy the existing population and ecosystems and enable easy colonation of Earth by the Ilien government. As Nat and Elen are ethically incorruptible, when they understand what they are being used for, they decide to act together independently of their creators to attempt to prevent the war, but did not succeed. A high-up in their social welfare organization committed many war crimes against the Ilienians, so Nat and Elen decided to intervene and take back control of the organization, which resulted in it schisming between those loyal to them and those loyal to the high-up. After this apocalyptic event, there is a single community remaining on Earth, of 40 people, and one underground bunker in Ilien holding 583 people who went in with the decision to not emerge for 100 years, by which time the war would hopefully have ended and they could restart their world. They are in the sunset again being romantic, looking over the destroyed planet. One asks the other, "We didn't find the right answer to preventing this war after all." The other says, "I don't think there was a right answer."</p> <h2 id="Part_3:_Dawn">Part 3: Dawn</h2> <p>Elen and Nat rebuild their social welfare project, redesigning it in such a manner that it is resistant to the corruption such as made it fall apart the first time. They begin, with these 40 humans and 583 Ilienians, collaboratively rebuilding the two societies. The rest of the story is about this rebirth, and slice-of-life / adventure stuff. At the end of the story, they are there watching over and caring for humanity, unseen and not acting. They don't act because they believe, and have told humanity that they believe, that it can (and must?) take care of its problems. Happy ending!</p> </main> </body> </html>
